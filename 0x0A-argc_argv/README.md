# Command Line Arguments ðŸš€

In this directory, we explore the world of command line arguments and create programs that manipulate them in various ways. Each program serves a unique purpose and demonstrates how to work with command line arguments effectively.

## Program Overview

### 0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to

- **Description:** Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If you rename the program, it will print the new name without having to compile it again. The program should not remove the path before the name of the program.

- **Usage:** Compile the program and run it to see the output, as demonstrated in the provided example.

### 1. Silence is argument carried out by other means

- **Description:** Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it. The program should print a number followed by a new line.

- **Usage:** Compile the program and run it with different numbers of arguments to observe the output.

### 2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter

- **Description:** Write a program that prints all arguments it receives. All arguments should be printed, including the first one. Print one argument per line, ending with a new line.

- **Usage:** Compile the program and run it with various arguments to see how it prints them.

### 3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is an argument

- **Description:** Write a program that multiplies two numbers. The program should print the result of the multiplication followed by a new line. If the program does not receive two arguments, it should print "Error" followed by a new line and return 1.

- **Usage:** Compile the program and run it with two numbers to observe the multiplication result. Try running it with less than two arguments to see the error message.

### 4. To infinity and beyond

- **Description:** Write a program that adds positive numbers. Print the result followed by a new line. If no numbers are passed to the program, print 0 followed by a new line. If any of the numbers contain symbols that are not digits, print "Error" followed by a new line and return 1.

- **Usage:** Compile the program and run it with various sets of positive numbers, including some with non-digit characters, to see how it handles addition.

## How to Use

For each program, navigate to its directory and follow the usage instructions provided above. Experiment with different inputs to fully understand their functionality.

## Important Notes

- Pay attention to the error messages when providing incorrect inputs.
- These programs demonstrate how to work with command line arguments effectively in C.
- Enjoy experimenting with command line arguments and enhancing your C programming skills!
