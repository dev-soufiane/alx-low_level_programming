# Elevating Functionality and Loops ðŸŒŸ

In this directory, we continue to explore the fascinating world of functions and loops, elevating our coding skills. Let's delve into the exciting tasks:

## Tasks Overview

### 0. isupper (0-isupper.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int _isupper(int c)` that checks for an uppercase character. Returns 1 if `c` is uppercase, 0 otherwise.
- **Usage:** Implement the `0-isupper.c` file to validate uppercase characters.

### 1. isdigit (1-isdigit.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int _isdigit(int c)` that checks for a digit (0 through 9). Returns 1 if `c` is a digit, 0 otherwise.
- **Usage:** Implement the `1-isdigit.c` file to validate digits.

### 2. Collaboration is Multiplication (2-mul.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int mul(int a, int b)` that multiplies two integers.
- **Usage:** Implement the `2-mul.c` file to calculate the product of two integers.

### 3. The Numbers Speak for Themselves (3-print_numbers.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_numbers(void)` that prints numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- **Usage:** Implement the `3-print_numbers.c` file with only two uses of `_putchar` to print the numbers.

### 4. I Believe in Numbers and Signs (4-print_most_numbers.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_most_numbers(void)` that prints numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4, followed by a new line.
- **Usage:** Implement the `4-print_most_numbers.c` file with only two uses of `_putchar`.

### 5. Numbers Constitute the Only Universal Language (5-more_numbers.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void more_numbers(void)` that prints numbers from 0 to 14 ten times, followed by a new line.
- **Usage:** Implement the `5-more_numbers.c` file with only three uses of `_putchar`.

### 6. The Shortest Distance Between Two Points is a Straight Line (6-print_line.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_line(int n)` that draws a straight line with `_` in the terminal. The line ends with a newline.
- **Usage:** Implement the `6-print_line.c` file to print a line with `_` repeated `n` times.

### 7. I Feel Like I Am Diagonally Parked in a Parallel Universe (7-print_diagonal.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_diagonal(int n)` that draws a diagonal line with `\` in the terminal. The diagonal ends with a newline.
- **Usage:** Implement the `7-print_diagonal.c` file to print a diagonal line with `\` repeated `n` times.

### 8. You Are So Much Sunshine in Every Square Inch (8-print_square.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_square(int size)` that prints a square using `#` in the terminal. The square ends with a newline.
- **Usage:** Implement the `8-print_square.c` file to print a square with dimensions defined by `size`.

### 9. Fizz-Buzz (9-fizz_buzz.c)

- **Description:** Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz." For multiples of five, print "Buzz." For multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz." Numbers and words are separated by spaces.
- **Usage:** Implement the `9-fizz_buzz.c` program that adheres to the Fizz-Buzz rules.

### 10. Triangles (10-print_triangle.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_triangle(int size)` that prints a triangle using `#` in the terminal. The triangle ends with a newline.
- **Usage:** Implement the `10-print_triangle.c` file to print a triangle with base size defined by `size`.
