# Recursion ðŸŒŸ

In this directory, we continue our journey into the world of C programming, exploring the concept of recursion. Recursion is a powerful technique that allows a function to call itself, enabling elegant solutions to various problems.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget (0-puts_recursion.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void _puts_recursion(char *s)` that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `0-puts_recursion.c` file to print a string using recursion and test it using the provided test code.

### 1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together (1-print_rev_recursion.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s)` that prints a string in reverse using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `1-print_rev_recursion.c` file to print a string in reverse using recursion and test it using the provided test code.

### 2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange (2-strlen_recursion.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int _strlen_recursion(char *s)` that returns the length of a string using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `2-strlen_recursion.c` file to find the length of a string using recursion and test it using the provided test code.

### 3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling (3-factorial.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int factorial(int n)` that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `3-factorial.c` file to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion and test it using the provided test code.

### 4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate (4-pow_recursion.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y)` that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `4-pow_recursion.c` file to calculate the power of a number using recursion and test it using the provided test code.

### 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer (5-sqrt_recursion.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int _sqrt_recursion(int n)` that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `5-sqrt_recursion.c` file to find the square root of a number using recursion and test it using the provided test code.

### 6. Inception. Is it possible? (6-is_prime_number.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int is_prime_number(int n)` that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise returns 0 using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `6-is_prime_number.c` file to check if a number is prime using recursion and test it using the provided test code.

### 7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything (100-is_palindrome.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int is_palindrome(char *s)` that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `100-is_palindrome.c` file to check if a string is a palindrome using recursion and test it using the provided test code.

### 8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible... (101-wildcmp.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2)` that compares two strings and returns 1 if they can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0. The second string `s2` can contain the special character `*`, which can replace any string (including an empty string) using recursion.
- **Usage:** Implement the `101-wildcmp.c` file to compare strings with wildcards using recursion and test it using the provided test code.
