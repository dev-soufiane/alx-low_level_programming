# More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings üåü

In this directory, we continue our exploration of pointers, arrays, and strings, building on the knowledge gained from previous assignments. Let's dive into these exciting tasks:

## Tasks Overview

### 0. strcat (0-strcat.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src)` that concatenates two strings. This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte.
- **Usage:** Implement the `0-strcat.c` file to concatenate two strings.

### 1. strncat (1-strncat.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n)` that concatenates two strings. The `_strncat` function is similar to the `_strcat` function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src, and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.
- **Usage:** Implement the `1-strncat.c` file to concatenate two strings using a specified number of bytes.

### 2. strncpy (2-strncpy.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n)` that copies a string. Your function should work exactly like `strncpy`.
- **Usage:** Implement the `2-strncpy.c` file to copy strings with a specified number of characters.

### 3. strcmp (3-strcmp.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2)` that compares two strings. Your function should work exactly like `strcmp`.
- **Usage:** Implement the `3-strcmp.c` file to compare two strings.

### 4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy (4-rev_array.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void reverse_array(int *a, int n)` that reverses the content of an array of integers.
- **Usage:** Implement the `4-rev_array.c` file to reverse an array of integers.

### 5. Always look up (5-string_toupper.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *string_toupper(char *)` that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- **Usage:** Implement the `5-string_toupper.c` file to convert a string to uppercase.

### 6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes (6-cap_string.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *cap_string(char *)` that capitalizes all words of a string.
- **Usage:** Implement the `6-cap_string.c` file to capitalize words in a string.

### 7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody (7-leet.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *leet(char *)` that encodes a string into 1337 according to the specified rules.
- **Usage:** Implement the `7-leet.c` file to encode a string into 1337 text.
