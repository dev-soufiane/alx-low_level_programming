# 0x00-hello_world: Explore the World of C Programming ðŸŒŸ

This directory is all about getting started with C programming and exploring the fundamental concepts. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each task in this directory.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Preprocessor (0-preprocessor)

- **Description:** Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
- **Usage:** Execute the script by providing the C file name as the `$CFILE` variable. The output will be saved in the file `c`.

### 1. Compiler (1-compiler)

- **Description:** Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- **Usage:** Run the script, specifying the C file name as the `$CFILE` variable. The output file will have the same name as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.

### 2. Assembler (2-assembler)

- **Description:** Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.
- **Usage:** Execute the script, passing the C file name as the `$CFILE` variable. The output file will have the same name as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.

### 3. Name (3-name)

- **Description:** Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
- **Usage:** Run the script with the C file name specified in the `$CFILE` variable.

### 4. Hello, puts (4-puts.c)

- **Description:** Write a C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line using the `puts` function.
- **Usage:** Compile and run the program. It should end with the value `0`.

### 5. Hello, printf (5-printf.c)

- **Description:** Write a C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line using the `printf` function.
- **Usage:** Compile the program with the `-Wall` option to ensure there are no warnings. The program should return `0`.

### 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation (6-size.c)

- **Description:** Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- **Usage:** Compile and run the program. It should produce the same output as the example.

### 7. Intel (100-intel)

- **Description:** Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
- **Usage:** Execute the script, specifying the C file name as the `$CFILE` variable. The output file will have the same name as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.

### 8. UNIX is Basically a Simple Operating System (101-quote.c)

- **Description:** Write a C program that prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, to the standard error.
- **Usage:** Compile and run the program. It should return `1` and compile without any warnings when using the `-Wall` gcc option.

## How to Use
