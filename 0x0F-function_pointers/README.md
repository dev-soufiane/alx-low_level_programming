# Function pointers ðŸ’¡

Welcome to the `0x0F-function_pointers` directory, where you will explore the fascinating world of function pointers in C. These tasks will challenge you to work with functions as first-class citizens, allowing you to perform operations dynamically based on function pointers.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. What's my name ðŸ“‡

- **Description:** Write a function that prints a name.

### 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done âŒ›

- **Description:** Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

### 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities ðŸŒŸ

- **Description:** Write a function that searches for an integer in an array using a custom comparison function.

### 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at ðŸŽ¯

- **Description:** Write a program that performs simple arithmetic operations based on user input.

## How to Use

For each task, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the usage instructions provided in the task description. Function pointers are a powerful concept that allows you to create flexible and dynamic code.

## Important Notes

- Pay attention to function prototypes and data structures.
- Utilize function pointers to perform operations dynamically.
- Ensure your code handles errors and edge cases gracefully.
- Experiment with various arithmetic operations to master the calculator task.
