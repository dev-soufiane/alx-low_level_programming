# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings üåü

In this directory, we dive into the world of pointers, arrays, and strings, strengthening our understanding of these fundamental concepts. Let's embark on this exciting journey:

## Tasks Overview

### 0. 98 Battery st. (0-reset_to_98.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void reset_to_98(int *n)` that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
- **Usage:** Implement the `0-reset_to_98.c` file to reset an integer to 98.

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream (1-swap.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void swap_int(int *a, int *b)` that swaps the values of two integers.
- **Usage:** Implement the `1-swap.c` file to swap the values of two integers.

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read (2-strlen.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int _strlen(char *s)` that returns the length of a string.
- **Usage:** Implement the `2-strlen.c` file to calculate the length of a string.

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them (3-puts.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void _puts(char *str)` that prints a string followed by a new line.
- **Usage:** Implement the `3-puts.c` file to print a string.

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear (4-print_rev.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_rev(char *s)` that prints a string in reverse followed by a new line.
- **Usage:** Implement the `4-print_rev.c` file to print a string in reverse.

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes (5-rev_string.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void rev_string(char *s)` that reverses a string.
- **Usage:** Implement the `5-rev_string.c` file to reverse a string.

### 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true (6-puts2.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void puts2(char *str)` that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
- **Usage:** Implement the `6-puts2.c` file to print every other character of a string.

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half (7-puts_half.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void puts_half(char *str)` that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
- **Usage:** Implement the `7-puts_half.c` file to print half of a string.

### 8. Arrays are not pointers (8-print_array.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_array(int *a, int n)` that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
- **Usage:** Implement the `8-print_array.c` file to print n elements of an array.

### 9. strcpy (9-strcpy.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src)` that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
- **Usage:** Implement the `9-strcpy.c` file to copy strings.
