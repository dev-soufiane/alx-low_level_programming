# Static Libraries ðŸ“š

In this directory, we delve into the world of static libraries. We create a static library called `libmy.a` containing various functions listed below. Additionally, we provide a script, `create_static_lib.sh`, to help you create a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files in the current directory.

## Functions Overview

### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

- **Description:** Create the static library `libmy.a` containing the following functions:

   - `int _putchar(char c);`
   - `int _islower(int c);`
   - `int _isalpha(int c);`
   - `int _abs(int n);`
   - `int _isupper(int c);`
   - `int _isdigit(int c);`
   - `int _strlen(char *s);`
   - `void _puts(char *s);`
   - `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`
   - `int _atoi(char *s);`
   - `char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);`
   - `char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);`
   - `char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);`
   - `int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`
   - `char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);`
   - `char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);`
   - `char *_strchr(char *s, char c);`
   - `unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);`
   - `char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);`
   - `char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);`

   If any of the above functions are not implemented, create empty ones with the correct prototypes.

- **Usage:** Create `libmy.a` and use it in your code as demonstrated in `main.c`.

### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

- **Description:** Create a script called `create_static_lib.sh` that creates a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files in the current directory.

- **Usage:** Execute `create_static_lib.sh` to generate `liball.a` containing the compiled object files from the `.c` files in the current directory.

## How to Use

For Task 0, compile the `libmy.a` library and use it in your programs by including `main.h`.

For Task 1, run the `create_static_lib.sh` script to create a static library `liball.a` from all the `.c` files in the current directory.

## Important Notes

- Ensure your functions meet the specified prototypes.
- Verify the correctness of your solutions by thorough testing.
- Explore and practice your coding skills with static libraries.
- Enjoy the journey of learning and coding!
