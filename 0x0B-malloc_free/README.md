# Memory Allocation and Freeing ðŸŒŸ

In this directory, we dive into memory allocation and freeing in C using the `malloc` and `free` functions. Each program showcases different aspects of dynamic memory management.

## Program Overview

### 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee

- **Description:** Write a function that creates an array of chars and initializes it with a specific char. Returns a pointer to the array or NULL if it fails.

- **Usage:** Check the provided example in `0-main.c` for how to use the `create_array` function.

### 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings

- **Description:** Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory containing a copy of the given string. Returns NULL if `str` is NULL or if memory allocation fails.

- **Usage:** See `1-main.c` for an example of using the `_strdup` function.

### 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life

- **Description:** Write a function that concatenates two strings and returns a pointer to the concatenated string. Treats NULL as an empty string and returns NULL on failure.

- **Usage:** Explore `2-main.c` for an example of using the `str_concat` function.

### 3. If you even dream of beating me, you'd better wake up and apologize

- **Description:** Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers. Each element is initialized to 0. Returns NULL on failure or if `width` or `height` is 0 or negative.

- **Usage:** Check out `3-main.c` for an example of using the `alloc_grid` function to create and print a grid.

### 4. It's not bragging if you can back it up

- **Description:** Write a function that frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by `alloc_grid`.

- **Usage:** Review `4-main.c` for an example of using the `free_grid` function to deallocate memory.

## How to Use

For each program, navigate to its directory and follow the usage instructions provided above. Experiment with different inputs to understand memory allocation and freeing in C.

## Important Notes

- Memory allocation and freeing are crucial aspects of programming, so pay attention to how these functions work.
- Always check if memory allocation was successful before using allocated memory.
- Proper memory management helps prevent memory leaks.
- These programs demonstrate dynamic memory management in C.
- Enjoy exploring and honing your memory allocation skills!
