# Preprocessor ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the `0x0D-preprocessor` directory, where you will explore the world of preprocessor directives and macros in the C programming language. Each task is designed to help you understand and utilize preprocessor macros effectively.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Object-like Macro (0-object_like_macro.h)

- **Description:** Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

### 1. Pi (1-pi.h)

- **Description:** Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

### 2. File name (2-main.c)

- **Description:** Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use the standard library.

### 3. Function-like macro (3-function_like_macro.h)

- **Description:** Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### 4. SUM (4-sum.h)

- **Description:** Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
