# Mastering the Art of Debugging üåü

In this directory, we explore the essential skill of debugging, which is crucial for identifying and fixing errors in software. Debugging is a critical part of becoming a proficient programmer. Let's dive into the debugging tasks:

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Multiple Mains (0-main.c, main.h)

- **Description:** In this task, you are not coding the solution but testing it! Create a file named `0-main.c` to test the `positive_or_negative()` function with a case of 0.
- **Usage:** This task involves creating a test file `0-main.c` to validate the behavior of the `positive_or_negative()` function.

### 1. Like, Comment, Subscribe (1-main.c)

- **Description:** Comment out (don't delete) the part of the code that causes an output infinite loop in the provided `1-main.c` file.
- **Usage:** Modify the `1-main.c` file to resolve the infinite loop issue.

### 2. 0 > 972? (2-largest_number.c, main.h)

- **Description:** This program prints the largest of three integers, but it's not working correctly. Fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly identifies and prints the largest of three numbers.
- **Usage:** Modify the `2-largest_number.c` file to ensure it correctly prints the largest number.

### 3. Leap Year (3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h)

- **Description:** This program converts a date to the day of the year and calculates the remaining days in the year, considering leap years. However, there are issues with its output. Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function in `3-print_remaining_days.c` so that it works correctly for all dates and leap years.
- **Usage:** Modify the `3-print_remaining_days.c` file to ensure accurate date-to-day conversion and remaining days calculation.

## How to Use

For each task, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the usage instructions provided above. Debugging tasks require careful analysis of existing code and making necessary modifications to resolve issues.

## Important Notes

- Maintain the line count specified in the tasks.
- Ensure you only make changes as instructed in each task.
- Take into account edge cases and validate the behavior of the programs thoroughly.
