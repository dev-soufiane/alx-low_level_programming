# More malloc, free ðŸŒŸ

In this directory, we delve into memory management in the C programming language, exploring the powerful concepts of dynamic memory allocation and reallocation using `malloc`, `free`, and `realloc`. Each task is designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of these memory manipulation techniques.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Trust no one (0-malloc_checked.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b)` that allocates memory using `malloc`.
- **Usage:** Implement the `0-malloc_checked.c` file to allocate memory with error checking and test it using the provided test code.

### 1. string_nconcat (1-string_nconcat.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n)` that concatenates two strings.
- **Usage:** Implement the `1-string_nconcat.c` file to concatenate strings with a specified length and test it using the provided test code.

### 2. _calloc (2-calloc.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void *_calloc(unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int size)` that allocates memory for an array using `malloc`.
- **Usage:** Implement the `2-calloc.c` file to allocate memory for an array with zero initialization and test it using the provided test code.

### 3. array_range (3-array_range.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `int *array_range(int min, int max)` that creates an array of integers.
- **Usage:** Implement the `3-array_range.c` file to create an array of integers within a specified range and test it using the provided test code.

### 4. _realloc (Advanced) (100-realloc.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void *_realloc(void *ptr, unsigned int old_size, unsigned int new_size)` that reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`.
- **Usage:** Implement the `100-realloc.c` file to reallocate memory blocks with specified conditions and test it using the provided test code.

### 5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope (Advanced) (101-mul.c)

- **Description:** Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers provided as command-line arguments.
- **Usage:** Implement the `101-mul.c` program to perform multiplication and handle command-line arguments as specified.
