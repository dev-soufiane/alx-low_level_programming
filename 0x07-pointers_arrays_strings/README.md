# More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings ðŸŒŸ

In this directory, we continue to dive deeper into the world of pointers, arrays, and strings, expanding our knowledge and skills. Let's explore the fascinating tasks awaiting you:

## Tasks Overview

### 0. memset (0-memset.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n)` that fills memory with a constant byte. This function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b.
- **Usage:** Implement the `0-memset.c` file to fill memory with a constant byte and test it using the provided test code.

### 1. memcpy (1-memcpy.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n)` that copies memory area. This function copies n bytes from the memory area src to the memory area dest.
- **Usage:** Implement the `1-memcpy.c` file to copy memory areas and test it using the provided test code.

### 2. strchr (2-strchr.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_strchr(char *s, char c)` that locates a character in a string. This function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found.
- **Usage:** Implement the `2-strchr.c` file to locate a character in a string.

### 3. strspn (3-strspn.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept)` that gets the length of a prefix substring. This function returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s, which consist only of bytes from accept.
- **Usage:** Implement the `3-strspn.c` file to get the length of a prefix substring.

### 4. strpbrk (4-strpbrk.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept)` that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. This function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept.
- **Usage:** Implement the `4-strpbrk.c` file to search for a set of bytes in a string.

### 5. strstr (5-strstr.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle)` that locates a substring. This function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack.
- **Usage:** Implement the `5-strstr.c` file to locate a substring in a string.

### 6. Chess is mental torture (7-print_chessboard.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_chessboard(char (*a)[8])` that prints the chessboard, represented as an 8x8 array of characters.
- **Usage:** Implement the `7-print_chessboard.c` file to print a chessboard.

### 7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire (8-print_diagsums.c)

- **Description:** Write a function `void print_diagsums(int *a, int size)` that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
- **Usage:** Implement the `8-print_diagsums.c` file to print the sum of diagonals in a square matrix.
