# Structures, typedef 🌟

Welcome to the `0x0E-structures_typedef` directory, where you will dive into the world of structures and typedefs in C. These tasks will help you understand how to define and manipulate complex data structures.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Poppy 🐕

- **Description:** Define a new type `struct dog` with the following elements:
  - `name`, type = `char *`
  - `age`, type = `float`
  - `owner`, type = `char *`

### 1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself 🐶

- **Description:** Write a function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.

### 2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad 🐕

- **Description:** Write a function that prints a `struct dog`.

### 3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read 📚
