# Singly linked lists 📜

Welcome to the `0x12-singly_linked_lists` directory, where you'll explore the world of singly linked lists in C. In this set of tasks, you will create and manipulate linked lists, which are essential data structures for many programming applications.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Print list 💻 

- **Description:** Write a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.

### 1. List length 📏

- **Description:** Write a function that returns the number of elements in a `list_t` list.

### 2. Add node 🌱

- **Description:** Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.

### 3. Add node at the end 🌿

- **Description:** Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.

### 4. Free list ♻️

- **Description:** Write a function that frees a `list_t` list.

### 5. The Hare and the Tortoise 🌃

- **Description:** Write a function that prints "You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!" before the `main` function is executed.

### 6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language 👨‍💻 

- **Description:** Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints "Hello, Holberton," followed by a new line.
